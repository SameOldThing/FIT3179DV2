            From the map, we can see that the country who
            <br>
            spends the most amount of money per capita
            <br>
            on gambling, is Australia. This means that in
            <br>
            Australia, minors are at a higher risk of being
            <br>
            exposed to gambling compared other countries
            <br>
            around the world.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 120%;">
            This type of gambling activity will leads to young
            <br>
            adults being falsely mislead into believing
            <br>
            that gambling may be a regular hobby or past time,
            <br>
            however, the reality is far from it.

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
        <p style="width: 49%;">
            The chart above indicates that gambling machines by far
            <br>
            contribute the net loss. What may seem like an
            <br>
            innocent $5 play may and often does turn into an
            <br>
            uncontrollable addiction. In conjunction with the
            <br>
            fact that most of these machines have bright,
            <br>
            colorful cartoons and animations for every spin,
            <br>
            and the results are catastrophic.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 120%;">
            The chart above also depicts wagering that is another primary
            <br>
            contributor to the net losses of Australia. Wagering is most
            <br>
            commonly called sports betting or horse betting. Much like
            <br>
            gambling machines, minors stand a high chance of being
            <br>
            exposed to sports/horse betting advertisements when they
            <br>
            themselves watch sport as they commonly appear during breaks.

            <span class="burlywood-text">Victoria</span> and <span class="plum-text">Queensland</span> contribute the
            most to the total gambling net loss of Australia. This indicates

            that while the risk of children and teenagers
            <br>
            being exposed to gambling in hese states is much
            <br>
            higher than others, but also indicates that these
            <br>
            states contain many individuals who suffer from
            <br>
            gambling addiction and financial difficulties.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 120%;">
            The chart also indicates a steep drop in net losses
            <br>
            in 2010 compared to previous years for <span class="darkorange-text">New South Wales</span>. This is due
            <br>
            to the new gambling regulations that were introduced in 2010.
            <br>
            These regulations were updated from the previous one in 2002,
            <br>
            and some changes include a ban on the use of credit cards to
            <br>
            gamble at casinos and licensed clubs among others and from
            <br>

            people around them too, so it is inherently linked to

            effect of unhealthy gambling habits. This means that individuals may

            experience a drop in their grades, or poor work output as a result
            <br>
            of excessive gambling which could lead to them losing their jobs.
